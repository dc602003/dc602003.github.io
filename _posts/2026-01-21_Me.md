So, my name is David Cooper. I'm an IT Consultant, nerd, geek, and music lover.
David is a Hebrew name meaning "beloved". Cooper is I believe from the German origins and was the trade of barrel making.
I don't think there's much need nowadays for a Beloved Barrel-Maker, but who knows how different my life would have been if I'd followed my name, and not had a fascination with dismantling and fixing IT equipment.
