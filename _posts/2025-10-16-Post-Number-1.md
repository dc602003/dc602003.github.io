# Post Number 1
I've started trying to train myself to write only in Markdown. The simple syntax, the open and accesible nature of formatting text which can be interpreted by multiple applications is truly exciting to me. I've spent my career working almost exclusively in Microsoft, with their proprietary file formats which then transitioned into their "borrowed" XML formats. I remember when Microsoft were dragged over the coals for this, and were requested to include the Open Document Format standards within the Office suite; giving users the ability to choose which format to use, whilst naturally highlighting the fact that their XML format was the best.

There was a time also where I was working for a local government organisation here in the UK, and central government were mandating that all new or modified documents were to be created in the Open Document Format. So what happened? People kept using the proprietary formats, because that what everyone knows.

So, after years of towing the Microsoft line, I'm making the decision to do things my way, and that includes this site. Using Markdown to write the blog posts, and have them hosted on Github.

That's it for post number 1. A quick history, and an intent for the future.
