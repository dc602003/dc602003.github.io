What do I do? I'm very much a family man, and spend my time away from work ensuring the happiness of my wife and children. Is this enough? There are things I so want to do, hobbies I'd love to have, adventures I'd like to go on, but the days seem so short. It's currently 22:30, and I know I should be in bed; my mind and body both tell me this, yet here I am tinkering, typing, and wondering if there is anything new to say about the human condition, what it is to be a man, and how I can find happiness in a world so seemingly gripped by things like war, fear, hatred, poverty, destitution, disease. 

I see these issues in the news, I see them first hand in the streets, yet I feel that much of the worlds problems can be fixed by we the people simply caring for each other, putting aside the self in favour of supporting those less fortunate, the simple acts of love and kindness which make such a difference to the lives of others.

Will I be a rich man? likely not. Will I be remembered once I'm gone? Likely only by a few. Will my small acts of love and kindness make a difference? Likely yes. Is this enough? Yes.

My life revolves around my family. I spend my time ensuring that my wife and children are cared for, supported, and loved. Everything else? Maybe in the next life. I'm happy with that.
