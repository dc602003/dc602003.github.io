Welcome to my site, dc602003.guthub.io. I would appreciate if you could all ensure that the comments on these articles are free from trolls, spam and abuse. The comment section can be a great place for interaction with other readers, and to ensure that you have a good time here, please make sure to stick to the following guidelines:

- Be polite, and don’t be rude to anyone and respect others. If something you would say would get you bottled on the head offline, please don’t say it here. Remember there is a person behind the screen and that your words affect people.
- Don’t troll. I appreciate and welcome criticism towards the aricles here, but comments that add no value to the discussion or that are merely insulting will be deleted without exception.
- Please don't Spam. Please refrain from posting spam or it will be deleted.

To put it in a simple sentence, the guidelines roughly equate to the wise words of Bill and Ted: “Be excellent to each other”.

If you don’t follow any of these guidelines, not only will the moderators remove the comment but we may also ban you from participating in the discussions.

If you find any comments which violate our guidelines, please make sure to ‘flag’ or ‘mark as spam’.

Thank you.
